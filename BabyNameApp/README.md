# App for showing baby names in the United States over time (R Shiny app)

This project looks at using the 'babynames' R package and using shiny and ggplot2.

The app allows the user to type in a name to lookup and gender to select and then display a barplot of number of babies born in the U.S from 1880 to 2018.

For security and identity reasons and concerns, babies born with names less than 5 times through that timeframe are omitted.
